XSPF
----
A simple [xspf](http://xspf.org) generator for python.

To install, either run
    python setup.py install
or copy xspf.py into your project.

Use
---
    import xspf
    x = xspf.Xspf()

    x.title = "my playlist"
    x.info = "http://example.org"
    # You can set these attributes:
    # title, creator, annotation, info, location, identifier, image, date, license

    # add a link or meta tag
    x.add_meta("http://example.org/key", "value")
    x.add_link("http://foaf.example.org/namespace/version1",
               "http://socialnetwork.example.org/foaf/mary.rdfs")
    # and delete them again if you want
    x.del_meta("http://example.org/key")

    # Add attributes at creation:
    y = xspf.Xspf(title="playlist", creator="alastair")
    # Or, with a dictionary
    z = xspf.Xspf({"title": "playlist", "creator": "alastair"})

    # Add tracks by creating a Track object
    tr1 = xspf.Track()
    tr1.title = ""
    tr1.creator = ""
    tr2 = xspf.Track(title="", creator="")
    tr3 = xspf.Track({"title": "", "creator": ""})
    # Tracks can have meta and link tags too
    tr1.add_meta("duration", 1000)
    x.add_track(tr1)
    x.add_tracks([tr2, tr3])

    # Or by passing the track information directly into add_track:
    x.add_track(title="", creator="")
    x.add_track({"title": "", "creator": ""})

    # Finally, get the XML contents
    print x.toXml()

If you don't like typing Xspf, we've helpfully aliased 'Spiff' to the same thing:

    from xspf import Spiff
    x = Spiff()
    ... etc

Reading xspf?
-------------
You might want to use [xspfparser](https://github.com/jwheare/xspfparser)

You can load a playlist parsed with xspfparser, modify it, then write it out again.

    result = xspfparser.parse(url)
    x = Xspf(result['playlist'])
    # we also support if you forget to deference playlist:
    y = Xspf(result)
    x.title = "New title"

    print x.toXml()

Compatibility
-------------
xspf.py is targeted to python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4. Other versions may work
but their output is not guaranteed. For example, python 2.6 works but
all tags are output with a fixed namespace prefix, `ns0:`. This is valid
XSPF, but some applications don't like it (e.g. VLC).
